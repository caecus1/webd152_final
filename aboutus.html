              In 1950, George Alcott Walker was stationed at the naval base in
              Point Loma. While there, he fell in love with the natural beauty
              the Southern California coastline had to offer, and made plans in
              a letter to his then fiancee and future wife Abigail to settle
              somewhere near the coast someday.
            </p>
            <p>
              That day came in 1953, when the newlyweds scouted a scenic but
              otherwise not very profitable tract of land with a simple cottage
              very much in need of repairs. WIth George's handy-work knowledge
              and Abigail's love of gardening, they made a lovely home for
              themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the next decade, they had a son, Walter in 1960. George
              continued touchups to the property, expanding the house and making
              a dedicated campsite for him and his family to enjoy on warm
              summer nights. Abigail expanded her garden work to simple, narrow
              paths that wound their way through the prettiest parts of the
              property.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1989, Abigail passed away peacefully, followed by George in
              1991. Walter, not wanting to part with the house, but also not
              finding it convenient to live there, hired workers and staff to
              expand the trails and the lodgings further, taking his father's
              love of camping in the summer and converting it into an exclusive
              retreat, offering equipment and dedicated campsites with guided
              trail tours, bird watching and included meals.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2012, Walter's son and the current owner, Arthur, took over the
              resort. A bit of an outdoors enthusiast himself, Arthur expanded
              further on both the trails and the offered activities to include
              kayaking and yoga. He also took inspiration from a friend and had
              the dedicated campsites rebuilt with luxury yurts to truly bring
              the camping experience into the 21st century!
